# Programming for Data Science Project:
##  _Where Should I Live?_

In the wake of increasing mobility across Europe, fueled by remote work,
international education, and shifting social and economic priorities, there has been
growing demand for tools that help citizens make better-informed decisions about
where to live. Recognizing this, the European Commission’s Directorate-General for
Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) has launched a new initiative
focused on improving access to comparative information about living conditions,
opportunities, and quality of life across member states.

To support this initiative, a data science task force was assembled, comprised of
researchers and developers across Europe. You were selected as part of this effort
to design a tool that translates complex country-level data into clear, actionable
insights for everyday people: students seeking affordable education, professionals
looking for better work-life balance, retirees interested in safety and healthcare, and
more.

Your project, "Where Should I Live", aims to simplify this decision-making process
by analyzing key characteristics of European countries, such as cost of living, safety,
and employment. Through exploratory analysis, visualizations, and interpretable
insights, your goal is to build a framework that empowers users to evaluate which
countries align best with their personal values and life goals.

## _Project Objectives_
Working in data science goes beyond technical expertise; it demands strong
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. 

The goals for this project are three-fold:

Data Wrangling and Analysis: In this phase, raw data is transformed into clean,
structured datasets. You’ll apply fundamental techniques to explore the data and
extract relevant insights about European countries.

Working with Advanced Topics: Here, you go beyond the basics by integrating
advanced concepts such as web scraping, geographical data, or other relevant data
types. This phase reflects the real-world challenges of gathering and handling
diverse data.

Data Science in Action: Finally, you’ll synthesize your work into a coherent
analysis. Using techniques of your choice, you’ll explore patterns, visualize
relationships, and generate actionable frameworks and conclusions. This phase is
open-ended, allowing for creativity, critical thinking, and deeper exploration.
